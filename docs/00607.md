看起来 DS 木马砌砖师[在野外](http://engadget.com/entry/1234000810062518/)。上面有指示要[搞定局面](http://www.dcemu.co.uk/vbulletin/showthread.php?t=12023)。上周 DarkFader 联系了我，想知道我是否对他对一直在流传的 PSP 恶意软件的回答感兴趣。我对这种黑客行为不感兴趣，因为我觉得破解东西需要更多的技巧**而不是**。以下是直接来自消息来源的信息，供感兴趣者参考:

* Erase DS firmware (but it can be recovered when the patch firmware is installed)
* Erase CompactFlash card
in GBA movieplayer * Erase GBA movieplayer firmware [T10 Of course, if you know what it does, no one will want to try it:)
But someone can rename it and add a different text file to make it more attractive to run
.
Not many people will run this program anyway. It's not as easy as on
PSP, because it requires a PassMe device.On October 7th, 2005, Eliot Phillips wrote:

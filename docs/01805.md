![](../Images/ee8bb7343b383e201bcdaa1ddd03ff30.png)[Peter Nyboer] has written an extensive post about [his experience with AudioCubes](http://createdigitalmusic.com/2008/05/20/hands-on-audiocubes-as-alternative-controller-for-music-and-visuals/) from [Percussa](http://www.percussa.com/). Aside from their unique glowing exterior, these cubes are an innovative way to control and even produce audio tracks. Four faces of each cube are equipped with IR sensors to detect distance and communicate with other cubes. The cubes also have USB, a rechargeable battery, and audio in/out. Moving your hands around the sensors changes the MIDI output of the cube. Changing the cubes’ orientation and distance from each other also changes the signal. [Max/MSP](http://www.cycling74.com/) and [Live](http://www.ableton.com/) are both supported out of the box, but that doesn’t mean it’ll be easy to get started. [Peter] makes an important point: unlike traditional instruments, there’s no obvious way to get started. At 400euro for 2 cubes and 650euro for 4 cubes, these devices aren’t exactly being given away, but it’s great to see new interfaces being imagined. A video of [Peter]’s first experiments with the cubes is embedded below; [read his full post](http://createdigitalmusic.com/2008/05/20/hands-on-audiocubes-as-alternative-controller-for-music-and-visuals/) to see more footage of the cubes in action… and naturally we’d love to see any DIY versions of this you can come up with.

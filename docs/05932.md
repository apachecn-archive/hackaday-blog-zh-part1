[Thomas] tipped us off about [a macro lens attachment for his Nexus One](http://dsynflo.blogspot.com/2010/09/diy-nexus-one-macro-lens.html). As you’d expect, adding the lens helps the phone’s camera bring tiny details into focus. He re-purposed a lens from a pair of mini binoculars, using epoxy putty to make a mounting bracket. Now the last time we saw this putty used with a phone it was for [a snap-in bracket that cradled the phone](http://hackaday.com/2010/05/06/building-removable-epoxy-mounting-brackets/) and included a lens adapter. Rather than go that route [Thomas] made use of the headphone jack just above the camera lens. An old headphone plug has been epoxied to the macro lens ring, holding it in place securely while remaining easily removable.

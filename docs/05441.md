We love our AVR Dragon programmer but it can be nice to have a cheap and simple in system programmer on hand too. The [USBasp](http://www.fischl.de/usbasp/) is one such programmer that uses and ATmega8 as its only IC. It requires just a handful of components and can be purchased as a kit, or etched and assembled at home. If you source your own parts the chip does need to be programmed which makes for a [chicken-or-egg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken_or_the_egg) scenario. We’ve used the Parallel-port dongle ([schematic](http://www.ladyada.net/media/spokepov/spokepov.png)) from Adafruit’s [Spoke POV](http://www.ladyada.net/make/spokepov/index.html) before. It’s basically just [a DAPA cable](http://www.instructables.com/id/Ghetto-Programming:-Getting-started-with-AVR-micro/) and a few resistors, a ribbon cable (use and old IDE cable if you have to) and a parallel port connector can have you up and running in no time. This is also a great way to get a friend into working with embedded systems. Order parts for a few of these and give them away to your buddies.

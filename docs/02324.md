In light of recent allegations of the [Chinese government installing monitoring software](http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/07/30/brownback.china/index.html) and hardware in foreign-owned hotels, the necessity of protecting one’s information has become vital and urgent, especially for journalists and photographers. [[Honig] provides some suggestions](http://beijing2008.popphoto.com/2008/07/cnn-report-chin.html?cid=16) for circumventing the infamous [Great Firewall of China](http://www.mahalo.com/Great_firewall_of_china); surfing the internet through a secure [VPN](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vpn) connection and using a proxy such as [PHProxy](http://www.phproxy.org/) will allow users to visit websites that have been banned within China. Such simple tricks could mean the difference between not being able to find necessary information, and the ability to surf the internet freely and openly.

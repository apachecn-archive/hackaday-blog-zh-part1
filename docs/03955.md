[[Pete](http://vimeo.com/user2156944)], a [musician](http://petelewisband.com/), and the guy behind SparkFun’s [pogobeds](http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/tutorial_info.php?tutorials_id=138) and [locking footprints](http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/tutorial_info.php?tutorials_id=114) has a sprinkler hack. He wanted to keep his dog, Choppy, happy with a green lawn while also keeping his sidewalk water free. To solve this problem, he hacked his sprinkler and hose to adjust the sprinkler’s range. He uses an [Arduino](http://www.arduino.cc/) to read a potentiometer signifying the direction that the sprinkler is facing and a servo to adjust a hose valve that controls the sprinkler’s water flow. Be sure to check out the video above to see it in action.

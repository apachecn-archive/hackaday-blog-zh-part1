</div><br/> [<a href="http://vimeo.com/user2156944" target="_blank">Pete</a>], a <a href="http://petelewisband.com/" target="_blank">musician</a>, and the guy behind SparkFun’s <a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/tutorial_info.php?tutorials_id=138" target="_blank">pogobeds</a> and<a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/tutorial_info.php?tutorials_id=114" target="_blank"> locking footprints</a> has a sprinkler hack. He wanted to keep his dog, Choppy, happy with a green lawn while also keeping his sidewalk water free. To solve this problem, he hacked his sprinkler and hose to adjust the sprinkler’s range. He uses an <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/" target="_blank">Arduino</a> to read a potentiometer signifying the direction that the sprinkler is facing and a servo to adjust a hose valve that controls the sprinkler’s water flow. Be sure to check out the video above to see it in action. </body> </html>

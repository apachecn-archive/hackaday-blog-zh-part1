# 黑客案件中可能的陷阱场景

> 原文：<https://hackaday.com/2008/08/13/possible-entrapment-scenario-in-hacking-case/>

![](img/1fe2990fc1d0e6a923b5c3ccd3f70287.png)[Brian Salcedo] made headlines a few years ago as a hacker who attempted to break into Lowe’s corporate network. He is currently serving a [nine-year prison sentence](http://www.usdoj.gov/criminal/cybercrime/salcedoSent.htm), one of the longest sentences for a computer hacking offense. Recent events surrounding a different hacking case have revealed that the buyer he worked for, [Albert “Segvec” Gonzalez], [was a Secret Service informant](http://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/2008/08/indicted-federa.html). [Salcedo] claims that were it not for [Gonzalez]’s threats, he would not have committed the hacking offense. While the [Secret Service](http://www.mahalo.com/Secret_service) may not have even been aware of [Gonzalez’s] activity with other hackers, [Salcedo] could make a case of entrapment by arguing that [Gonzalez] threatened him as a government agent in order to make him plant the sniffer in Lowe’s network.

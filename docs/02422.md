The [Lynxmotion Johnny 5 kit](http://www.lynxmotion.com/Category.aspx?CategoryID=103), based on the robot from the animated film [Short Circuit](http://www.mahalo.com/Short_circuit), is powered by the compact [VIA EPIA P700 board](http://www.via.com.tw/en/products/mainboards/motherboards.jsp?motherboard_id=690), and aimed at beginner robotic hobbyists. VIA claimed that its use of the latest board allows for much easier software development. VIA also showcased the [Mini-ITX](http://mini-itx.com/) powered Vecna Battlefield Extraction-Assist Robot (or [BEAR](http://www.viaarena.com/default.aspx?PageID=5&ArticleID=529&P=1)), a cuddly-looking robot with potential uses in military and rescue operations.

![](../Images/f7c8a7763c7bf7eb465214d0fba61bad.png "analog-LED-tricks")We look at a lot of projects that have microcontrollers in them. That’s because microcontrollers do cool stuff, but there are still plenty of tricks you can pull off with analog circuits. [[Osgeld’s] latest project explores this realm](http://www.instructables.com/id/No-CPU-MCU-led-pulse-fade), controlling the discharge of capacitors through an LED. His setup uses just nine components and, if you’ve been collecting broken electronics from your friends and neighbors like a good hacker, you can scavenge all of these parts. Try it, you’ll like it!

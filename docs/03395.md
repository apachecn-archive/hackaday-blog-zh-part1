</div><br/> [Steve] is in the MFA Design and Technology program at parsons, and as part of his studies, has built a couple really interesting projects. First, the <a href="http://www.vargatron.com/blogatron/2009/04/07/beat-boxxx/" target="_blank">Beat boxxx</a>, as seen in the video above, is an 80’s retro looking portable beat looper. You create and loop your beats at the time of playing using simple hand gestures. The look is great, for those who enjoy cardboard and magic marker, though we think some tonal variation and possibly a wider pitch variation would really make this fun. <p>他的第二个项目是<a href="http://www.vargatron.com/blogatron/2009/03/12/speak-to-mebreathe/" target="_blank">对我说话/呼吸</a>。这个项目旨在对我们日常信息的安全性进行评论。他正在可视化地显示盲文符号，以拼出他的电子邮件。如果有人愿意花力气，他们可以破译他的电子邮件。这个项目的完成非常好，休息后你可以看到一个视频展示。</p> <p><span id="more-10352"/> <br/></p><div class="embed-vimeo" style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/3616219" width="800" height="480" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""/></div> </body> </html>

Evil Mad Scientist posted a story about [what went into developing the Bulbdial clock](http://www.evilmadscientist.com/article.php/bulbdial3). We think [the Bulbdial](http://hackaday.com/2009/12/10/bulbdial-clock-kit-released/) is one of the best pieces of kit out there for many reasons; using colored shadows for each hand is a brilliant idea, the design is clever and uses a low parts count, and the concentric rings that make it work also add to the aesthetic. But after seeing the [original wood prototype](http://hackaday.com/2009/04/08/the-bulbdial-clock-comes-to-life/) it had crossed our minds that developing those circular PCBs isn’t the easiest thing to pull off. To save on board cost, the first run didn’t have the center routed out, but rather used almost-touching holes drilled during manufacture and finished by hand during assembly. They also go on to discuss the use of [Charlieplexing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlieplexing) to reduce part count and the search for a suitable diffuser for the clock face.

We certainly don’t mind them, especially when they involve hiring a notable hacker to do the company’s dirty work. It seems this is exactly what happened in the case of Dish Networks vs NDS Group. Last month, Christopher Tarnovsky [admitted he was paid $20,000 in cash](http://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/2008/04/hacker-in-murdo.html) to crack the security protocols used on DISH Network access cards. NDS Group claimed the reverse engineering was simply for comparative reasons while DISH is said it resulted in $900 million in damages.

审判于本周结束，法庭判定 NDS 集团破解了一张卡(罚款 49.69 美元)并承担 1000 美元的额外赔偿。不太大的回报盘是希望的，但两家公司都表达了对该决定的感情。DISH Networks 表示，陪审团做出了有利于他们的裁决，证明他们一直都是对的(只是 9 亿美元不对)。NDS 坚称塔尔诺夫斯基的作品从未被公开分享，他们也从未打算像 DISH 暗示的那样用破解卡充斥黑市。

# 建筑材料用聚氯乙烯管件

If you’ve used PVC as a building material in your projects you may have run into trouble finding a way to make three pipes joint at right angles to each other (like the corner of a box outline). That’s because there’s no need for that type of joint when plumbing, the intended purpose of the PVC pipes. But [John] tipped us off about [FORMUFIT PVC Fittings](http://formufit.com/) designed for construction use instead of plumbing. There’s a lot of interesting options, such as the ninety degree connectors, rounded end caps for aesthetics, and end caps designed to receive casters. We also enjoyed seeing the T connector that slides onto a pipe and can function as a swivel. We haven’t tried them out ourselves, but we think they’d come in hand whether you’re building [complicated moving structures](http://hackaday.com/2010/03/24/theo-jansen-like-the-professor-from-gilligan/) or just making a desk.

![](../Images/cf30115c2c3aae78a5ddbe2c34280559.png)[Chris Harrison] and a friend created these [motherboard walls](http://www.chrisharrison.net/projects/motherboardslab/index.html) for Carnegie Mellon professor [Scott Hudson]. According to [Harrison], he amassed over 150 pounds of motherboards, most of them off of eBay, to create this surreal project. Nearly every inch of the lab is covered with motherboards, of different lengths and varying shades of green, silver, and black. We think it’s pretty festive.

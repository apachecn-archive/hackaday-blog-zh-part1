**更新:**

**读者们，你们好，
很抱歉更新延迟了。编辑们和杰森一起解决一些问题的时候，我还在试用期。**

显然，对于我最近的第一篇文章，我对 Android 操作系统的研究不够深入。在阅读了你们的每一条评论后，我意识到这篇文章没有达到民政总署及其读者对高质量写作和报道的标准。我在文章中提出的每一点都是我在使用 Android 的过程中注意到的问题，但我应该对其他人的体验和每个版本的操作系统的功能做更多的研究。对于每一位读者，我很抱歉，在以后的文章中，我会在你们的帮助下做得更好。

Poor Google. Despite its numerous capabilities with smartphones spread across a variety of carriers, Android still struggles to garner the prestige and positive perceptions of iOS 4\. Sales continue to rise, but at the end of the day, the average person is still left lusting for an iPhone. Well, here are 10 features  that should be added to Android 3.0 that could change the tide.**1\. A no-brainer task manager.**Google says Android doesn’t need a task manager, that it closes programs efficiently without any user-intervention, substandard apps often suck memory dry. Because of this, Android users are forced to download complicated task-managers, each with its own odd UI, and weigh which one works the best. Google, please fess up to the problem and put something in there a computer novice could use.  Something with big buttons would be nice.**2\. Stable Multitasking**Speaking of crashes, multitasking on Android is a mess.  A little optimization here wouldn’t hurt. Better yet, while this may run counter-productive to us power-users, why not release a lite version of Android 3.0 that doesn’t support multitasking? Not every user needs it and lower-end phones would appreciate it**3\. [Swype](http://www.swypeinc.com/)**Google, your Android keyboard sucks. That’s why the fine folks at Swype Inc developed their product. Sure, some of the newer Android phones like the [Droid X](http://www.motorola.com/Consumers/US-EN/Consumer-Product-and-Services/Mobile-Phones/Motorola-DROID-X-US-EN?localeId=33) are releasing with it built in, but it would be a boon for the OS to come packaged with this software.**4\. IR- sender support**On the hardware side of things, an IR-sender support is a “duh.” Imagine a next generation of remotes running on Android. Better yet, how would you like to control your lights and home-entertainment center with your phone without the sometimes-complicated mess of configuring through a network?**5\. Universal pinch-to-zoom**Some apps have it. Some apps don’t. C’mon, this should be standard by now.**6\. Folders**Google, [you copied iOS’s homescreen UI](http://www.engadget.com/2010/07/09/googles-larry-page-steve-jobs-is-rewriting-history-by-saying/), why not do it again? Many of users have outgrown their limited pages and would like a way to add some organization to their mobile lives.**7\. SD-Card support for app-storage**If users are going to download a ton of apps from the Android Market, they need somewhere to put them. Users with rooted phones can already do this, but expandable storage should be standard in app-filled world with insatiable memory lust.**8\. Built-in syncing**If the Android is going to succeed as a user-friendly platform, it needs to make it easy for people to add their music, photos, and video to their phones. It’s simple Google. Develop some web-based software and launch it as a beta. You do it for everything else…**9\. Standardized UI for all apps**I’m all for artistic interpretation, but the reason so many functional apps get low scores is because they work differently than the rest of the OS. Once again, do what Apple did and come up with better UI guidelines.**10\. Better market**Why can’t I queue downloads from the web? That would be awesome. How about a better way to navigate the store from my laptop? Despite the thousands of apps the Android Market hosts, it is stuck with the same problems as Apple’s iOS4\. More importantly than any of the above, Google needs to innovate here. Change the way mobile markets work Google and you could win this war.

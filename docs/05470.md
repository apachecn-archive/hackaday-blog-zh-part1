[Justin] shows us how to [make a Linux tablet out of a BeagleBoard](http://antipastohw.blogspot.com/2010/06/diy-gadgets-with-beagleboard.html). You may remember [Justin’s] work at [liquid cooling an Arduino](http://hackaday.com/2010/02/16/ultimate-flame-bait-liquid-cooled-arduino/). For this one he moved past the AVR hardware but took the idea of shields along for the ride. The device above is something of a Linux tablet, with a touchscreen shield on top of the [BeagleBoard](http://hackaday.com/2010/05/27/gsoc-takes-on-xbmc-on-the-beagleboard/), and one below it for power. He’s selling these as kits which include the 480×272 OLED display as long as you can handle the fine-pitch soldering for those headers. We’re not sure our hands are steady enough for the challenge.[Thanks Will]

Quad copters have been pretty popular for the last few years, but this one is new to us. Take the same basic layout, but bump it to 6 rotors. Then you’ll have [the hexacopter](http://mikrokopter.de/ucwiki/en/MK-Hexa) (google [translated](http://translate.google.com/translate?js=y&prev=_t&hl=en&ie=UTF-8&layout=1&eotf=1&u=http://mikrokopter.de/ucwiki/en/MK-Hexa&sl=de&tl=en)). With 6 rotors, built in GPS and stabilization and a camera mounted on the bottom, this thing is pretty well equipped. You can see how agile and stable it is in the video above. We know it isn’t necessarily new, but it is new to us. Of course, you don’t have to stop at 6 rotors. You could always just [continue on to 8](http://mikrokopter.de/ucwiki/VideoAbspielen?id=189).
